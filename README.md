# Unique random numbers (random module)
This repository contains a Python script that generates a list of unique random integers from 0 to a specified maximum number (inclusive).

## Usage
To use this script, simply run it in your terminal or command prompt. You will be prompted to enter the following inputs:

- seed: an integer value to initialize the random module

- how_many: the number of unique random integers to generate

- max_num: the maximum value for the generated random integers (inclusive)

- The script will then output a list of how_many unique random integers from 0 to max_num (inclusive), along with the number of retries (i.e., the number of times a generated random number was already in the list).

## Features
- Generates a list of unique random integers from 0 to a specified maximum number (inclusive)

- Uses a seed value to initialize the random module for reproducibility

- Counts the number of retries (i.e., the number of times a generated random number was already in the list)
